# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static website for Fractal Boston, a community organization. The site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript - no build tools or frameworks are used.

## Architecture

- **Static Site**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS with no build process
- **Main Page**: `index.html` - Community landing page with description, call-to-action, and Google Analytics
- **Interest Form**: `interest-form/index.html` - Simple redirect page to Google Forms
- **Styling**: 
  - `normalize.css` - CSS reset
  - `blocks.min.css` - External CSS framework
  - `styles.css` - Custom site styles
- **Assets**:
  - `font/` - Custom Fractul font files
  - `img/` - Logo and community images
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (gtag) tracking for engagement events

## Development

Since this is a static site with no build process:
- Changes can be made directly to HTML/CSS/JS files
- Test by opening `index.html` in a browser or using a local server
- No package manager, dependencies, or build commands

## Deployment

The site appears to be deployed via GitHub Pages (based on `CNAME` file presence).

## Key Features

- Community landing page with call-to-action button
- Newsletter signup (Substack embed)
- Interest form redirect to Google Forms
- Google Analytics event tracking for button clicks
- Responsive design with custom CSS
